<p>Giesing is a formerly popular neighborhood which currently goes through a gentrification process. As a result, the area has a very different vibe than other areas in Munich, with hipster caf√©s
    among flea markets and popular brewries. It's a nice neighborhood, close to the Isar and to the city center by public transportation. Rents tend to be relatively cheaper.</p>
